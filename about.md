## The LtB UI Toolkit is an effort to expedite design, prototyping & testing of the app.

> User interface toolkits are helpful for ensuring consistent quality in your web software products and encouraging rapid prototyping in agile software environments. â€” Grace Snapp

Here at HackOregon, we are employing this method to speed our iterative design cycle, collaborate and test early and often.
 
 Our goals are to...
 
- build consistently, focusing our energy on workflows and logic, not web forms and list items.
- reuse code instead of reinventing the wheel or roping in an engineer.
- see all of our patterns in one place, quickly revealing maintenance issues.
